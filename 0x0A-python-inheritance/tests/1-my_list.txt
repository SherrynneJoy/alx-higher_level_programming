How to use 1-my_list.py
================================

This module defines a class MyList that inherits from list.

usage
=====
The class has a function to sort integers in ascending order.
``print_sorted(...)``accepts integers and prints them in order.

::

	>>> print_sorted = __import__('1-my_list').MyList
	>>> MyList = [2, 1, 3, 5, 4]
	>>> print_sorted()
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

If the numbers are in descending order, they are made into ascending order

::

	>>> MyList = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
	>>> print_sorted()
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The numbers should be of type integer only.

::

	>>> MyList = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
	>>> print_sorted()
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Invalid Cases
=============

::

If the elements in the list are not of type int, a TypeError is raised

::

	>>> MyList = [3.1, 2.4, 5.5, 6.9]
	>>> print_sorted()
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: list must be an integer

::

	>>> MyList = ["Hello", "Joy", "Bye"]
	>>> print_sorted()
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: list must be an integer

::

	>>> MyList = [None]
	>>> print_sorted()
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: list must be an integer
